# The Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz
The Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz is a quiz that determines the Hogwarts house the site user sorts into depending upon the choices they select for each question. Specifically, it is designed with 'Potterheads' in mind to provide a morsel of the experiences in the wizarding world for us 'muggles'.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography
[CDN Fonts](https://www.cdnfonts.com/harrypotter7.font) were used to import the 'HarryPotter7' font applied to the 'Start' button.

- The 'HarryPotter7' font was selected as it's a calligraphic font which appears similar to that of the handwriting style used within the: magic textbooks, letters & Diagon Alley signage.

### Imagery

As the quiz is based on the wizarding world of Harry Potter, I have selected the background image of Diagon Alley because it recreates the atmosphere of being a first-year student gathering school supplies and readying for September when the Sorting Hat would determine your Hogwarts House.

## Features

### General features on each page

 The site contains three pages: home page, quiz page & results page. 
 All the pages consist of:
 - A favicon in the browser tab. 

 ![Favicon](/documentation/images/favicon-features.png)

 - The Harry Potter logo at the top of each site page which, in turn, is a link back to the home page. 

 ![Harry Potter logo](/documentation/images/hp-logo-features.png)

### The Home Page

The Home Page exhibits the Harry Potter logo as its title since it is easily recognisable, ensuring the site users are informed of the theme behind the website; following that, a row of the house crests is displayed underneath to relate to the purpose of the quiz which is to determine which Hogwarts house the site user is more tailored towards. What's more, there are audio controls in which the user can optionally play the sound of entering the Great Hall which, in turn, contributes to providing the site user with the atmosphere of Hogwarts & the wizarding world. Finally, there is a 'Start' button granting the user access to participate in the quiz.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to develop the wireframes during the design process. 
- [GitHub:](https://github.com/) created the repository in which the project's code is pushed to from Git. 
- [Git:](https://git-scm.com/) was used within the GitPod Terminal in order to add, commit & push to GitHub. 
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to convert the Sorting Hat PNG into a Favicon. 


Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

### Code Used
- [GreatStack:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8&t=27s)

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)  was used to include the following code:
-  [Favicon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_favicon.asp)
-  [Alignment of images](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp)
-  [Center alignment of button](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_center-flex_btn)
-  [Shadow buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp)
    

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

- The structure and sections of content are taken from the README.md exemplar file developed by [Kera Cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md).

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.
